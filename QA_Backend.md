  },
  "destination": "paris",
  "room": [
    {
      "guest": [
        {
          "type": "ADT"
        },
        {
          "type": "ADT"
        },
        {

        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "placeId": "ChIJD7fiBh9u5kcRYJSMaMOCCwQ"
}
```
Conditions: 
 - Dates should be dynamic
 - Room and guest array should be created dynamically
 
Response validations: Perform needed validations on API response

## General Conditions:
- Any framework using any programming language
- POM
- Integration with Junit

## What we are looking for
A code we can Trust!

This code is meant for testing, and passed execution does not mean working application; maybe testing code needs to be tested in the first place

## Questions And Delivery
If you have any questions to this challenge, please do reach out to us.

The challenge should be delivered as a link to a public git repository (github.com or bitbucket.com are preferred).
