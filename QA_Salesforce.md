# Salesforce QA - Code Challenge
The main objective of this assignment is to measure the candidateâ€™s test engineering skills.

## General Information
Please read the information below carefully before proceeding to the next section.
- Code challenge should be submitted as a link to a public git repository (github.com is preferred).
- We are looking for code that we can Trust! Follow best practices for coding & automation (OOP, POM, reusable, clean, documented code, etc).
- Implementations focusing on quality over feature completeness will be highly appreciated. Do not feel compelled to implement everything and even if you are not able to complete the challenge in the given time, please submit the work done anyways.
- Remember, A test passing an execution does not mean that the application works as expected. Ensure you look out for false negative and false positive tests.
